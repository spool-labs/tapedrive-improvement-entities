# TAPEDRIVE IMprovement Entities (TIMEs)

**TIMEs** are design proposals for significant changes to the TAPEDRIVE protocol. Each TIME describes a specific change or addition, including its motivation, design details, and expected impact on the network.

The goal of TIMEs is to make protocol development transparent, encourage community feedback, and create a clear historical record of how TAPEDRIVE evolves over time.

## Status Definitions

- **Draft**: Under discussion, or development, not yet finalized
- **Complete**: Tested and ready for devnet
- **Final**: Fully implemented and active on the network
