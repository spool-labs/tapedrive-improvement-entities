# Tapedrive IMprovement Entities (TIMEs)

TIMEs (previously [TIMDs](https://x.com/tapedrive_io/status/1946476308751696377)) are design proposals for significant changes to the TAPEDRIVE protocol. Each TIME describes a specific change or addition, including its motivation, design details, and expected impact on the network.

The goal of TIMEs is to make protocol development transparent, encourage community feedback, and create a clear historical record of how TAPEDRIVE evolves over time.
